name: S4-modeling
description: STUB. a feature set and the spec's success metric exist and models need to be trained and error-analyzed. Make sure to use this skill whenever the agentic data science pipeline reaches the Modeling stage, or when the user mentions modeling, training, experimentation, model selection, or error analysis.

# S4 — Modeling

> **Status: STUB.** Infrastructure (orchestration, contract validation,
> ledgering, loop control) is handled by `../../PLUGIN.md`. This skill only
> needs the four sections below filled in.

## Role in the pipeline

Trains and compares models against the spec metric and produces error analysis that can point back at features.

## 1. Pre-contract (consumes)

**Input contract type(s):** `FeatureSetContract` + `SpecContract`

> Fill in: the exact `payload` fields this skill reads, and which are
> hard pre-conditions (missing them ⇒ emit `BLOCKED`) vs. soft
> (missing them ⇒ proceed with a recorded `assumption`).

| Field | From | Hard? | Used for |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

## 2. Post-contract (produces)

**Output contract type:** `ModelContract`
**Payload schema:** `../../contracts/ModelContract.schema.json`

> Fill in: the exact `payload` fields this skill guarantees on
> `COMPLETE`, and what a `PARTIAL` looks like (which fields may be
> omitted/sampled and still be downstream-usable).

| Field | Type | Required on COMPLETE | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------------|-------|
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

## 3. Procedure

> Fill in: the layered internal steps. Keep them ordered and idempotent so
> a re-entry after a feedback loop is safe.

1. _TBD_

## 4. Feedback triggers

> Fill in: conditions under which this skill emits
> `status = NEEDS_REVISION` plus a `revision_request`, and which edge it
> takes. Edges and their iteration budgets are defined in
> `../../PLUGIN.md` §4 and `../../orchestrator/config.yaml`.

| Condition | Edge | Routes to | What must change next pass |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| error analysis points to a missing/weak feature | S4->S3 | S3 | added or strengthened feature | |
